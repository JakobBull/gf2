## How we work

For now we will manage our own branches as there should be no conflicts. Please make sure to pull any updates before you start working to avoid merge conflicts. Make sure you work in your branch not the main branch by using 

"git checkout {branch-name}"

Once you have updates to your code that you are happy with you can merge this by running. 

"git checkout main"

"git merge {branch-name}"

and then pushing it to the remote tracking repository.
